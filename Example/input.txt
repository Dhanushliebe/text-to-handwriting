Title: 8051 programming.
Problem Definition: Write a 8051 Program to
a) Add ‘n’ 8-bit nos. found in internal RAM location 40h onwards and store result in
R6 and R7 register
Aim: To understand concept of register bank, bit addressable area, internal memory
organization, various addressing modes,
Hardware and Software requirements: IBM PC, Keil software
Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Load count value in register.
3. Point Ro to internal memory location
4. Clear Accumulator
5. Add accumulator with memory contents pointed by R0
6. If carry is not generated go to step8
7. Increment R6
8. Increment R0
9. Decrement counter
10. If counter is not zero go to step 5
11. Store result of final addition in register R7
12. Stop.
Conclusion:
We have studied to access internal memory.
Result:
Internal memory
I: 0x40 01 02 03 04
After addition
R6=0 R7=0A
